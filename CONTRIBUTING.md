## Style Guidelines

### JavaScript (Google Apps Script)

```javascript
// Use descriptive function names
function calculateSessionProgress(sessionNumber, totalSessions) {
  // Add JSDoc comments for functions
  /**
   * Calculates the percentage progress through the program
   * @param {number} sessionNumber - Current session number
   * @param {number} totalSessions - Total number of sessions
   * @returns {number} Progress percentage
   */
  return (sessionNumber / totalSessions) * 100;
}

// Use const/let instead of var
const MAX_SESSIONS = 60;
let currentSession = 1;

// Use meaningful variable names
const workoutData = collectSessionData();  // Good
const wd = collectSessionData();           // Bad
```

### HTML/CSS

```html
<!-- Use semantic HTML -->
<article class="exercise-card">
  <header class="exercise-header">
    <h3 class="exercise-name">Squats</h3>
  </header>
  <section class="exercise-content">
    <!-- Content -->
  </section>
</article>

<!-- Keep styles organized -->
<style>
  /* Component styles grouped together */
  .exercise-card { }
  .exercise-header { }
  .exercise-content { }
  
  /* Use consistent spacing */
  .component {
    margin: 15px;
    padding: 20px;
  }
</style>
```

### Best Practices

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract common functionality
- **KISS (Keep It Simple)**: Avoid over-engineering
- **Responsive Design**: Test on multiple screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Use proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Performance**: Minimize API calls to Google Sheets
